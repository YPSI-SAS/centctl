## Enabling shell autocompletion
### Install bash-completion
You can install it with `apt-get install bash-completion`

The above commands create `/usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion`, which is the main script of bash-completion. Depending on your package manager, you have to manually source this file in your `~/.bashrc file`.

To find out, reload your shell with command `source ~/.bashrc` and run `type _init_completion`. If the command succeeds, youâ€™re already set, otherwise add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```sh
source /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
```

Reload your shell and verify that bash-completion is correctly installed by typing `type _init_completion`

### Enable centctl autocompletion
Add the completion script to the `/etc/bash_completion.d` directory:

```sh
centctl completion >/etc/bash_completion.d/centctl
``` 

After reloading your shell, centctl autocompletion should be working.
