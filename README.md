# CENTCTL

## Presentation
Centctl is a CLI which allows to manage Centreon servers. Centctl use a file named `centctl.yaml` for manage the connection at differents servers. </br>
Developped in Go, it allows to operate a Centreon platform remotely from a PC under Windows, Linux or Macos without any particular installation.

## Config File
Create a file called `centctl.yaml` in your PC and put the complete path of this file in an environment variable named `CENTCTL_CONF`.<span style="color: #FF0000"> WARNING </span> : This variable is required. For example:

`export CENTCTL_CONF=/home/mister/centctl/centctl.yaml`

<br/>For declare a server use the configuration below by replacing capitalized words

* `NAMESERVER` it's the name of the server that you will use in the flag --server. <span style="color: #FF0000"> WARNING </span> : The name of the server must be unique
* `URL` it's the url at use for access to your centreon server. Its format is **https://monserveurcentreon.fr/centreon** and you replace **monserveurcentreon.fr** by the server. <span style="color: #FF0000"> WARNING </span> : remember to put **http** if your url is not a secure url
* `insecure` key is use when the URL server is in https. It is same the flag (--insecure) to forced the connection.
* `LOGIN` it's the login that you use for the connection at the server
* `PASSWORD` it's the password that you use for the connection at the server
* `VERSION` it's the version of the API that you want to use (possibles values : v1 or v2)
* `default` define the default server to connected 
</br>To define the proxy if your server use it, you have three ways:
  - Define an environment variable named `http_proxy`. Its format is **http://IPAddress:Port** or **http://USERNAME:Password@IPAddress:Port** (In this case all servers use the same proxy) or an environment variable named `https_proxy. Its format is the same of http_proxy
  - Define proxy in the top of the yaml file (In this case all servers use the same proxy)
  ```yaml
  proxy:
    - httpURL: "URLProxy"
    - httpsURL: "URLSProxy"
    - user: "USERNAME"
    - password: "PASSWORD" 
  servers:
    - server: "NAMESERVER2"
      url: "URL" 
      login: "LOGIN"
      password: "PASSWORD"
      version: "VERSION"
  ``` 
  - Define differents proxies for each server which used it like below.
</br>It is possible to have servers without a proxy like the NAMESERVER2 below. It is possible to have servers without httpProxy or without httpsProxy, for this case keep the field and use blank value (example: - httpsURL: "").
* `URLProxy` it's the ipAddress and port at use for access to your http proxy. Its format is **IPAddress:Port**
* `URLSProxy` it's the ipAddress and port at use for access to your https proxy. Its format is **IPAddress:Port**
* `USERNAME` it's the user that you use for connection at the proxy (If you don't use it, leave the field blank )
* `PASSWORD` it's the password that you use for connection at the proxy (If you don't use it, leave the field blank )

```yaml
servers:
   - server: "NAMESERVER"
     url: "URL" 
     insecure: true
     login: "LOGIN"
     password: "PASSWORD"
     version: "VERSION"
     default: true
     proxy:
      - httpURL: "URLProxy"
      - httpsURL: "URLSProxy"
      - user: "USERNAME"
      - password: "PASSWORD" 
   - server: "NAMESERVER2"
     url: "URL" 
     login: "LOGIN"
     password: "PASSWORD"
     version: "VERSION"

```

## To manage passwords
To manage passwords and for don't have the password written clearly in config file you have two possibilities.
### First solution
The first solution consists in don't write the password into the yaml file and the CLI ask you to give the password in the terminal before a command.
<br/> In this case, your yaml file look like this (the parameter password no longer appears):

```yaml
servers:
   - server: "NAMESERVER"
     url: "URL" 
     login: "LOGIN"
     version: "VERSION"
     default: true
   - server: "NAMESERVER2"
     url: "URL" 
     login: "LOGIN"
     version: "VERSION"
```

### Second solution 
The second solution consist in encrypt the passwords present in the config file. 
<br/> To encrypt the password enter this command:
```sh
centctl encrypt
``` 

When this command succeed, the passwords in file are encrypt and the result of this command give you the `encryption key`. To decode your passwords after that, centctl **NEEDS** this key, consequently you **MUST** save this key in an environment variable named `CENTCTL_DECRYPT_KEY`. 
```sh
export CENTCTL_DECRYPT_KEY="THE_KEY_RETURNED_BY_THE_COMMAND"
``` 

If you modify passwords or add new server in config file, when you use the command `encrypt` the key used is the same that the first time.

If you loose this key, you must rewrite the passwords in the config file and reexecute the above command.

## CSV File
Create a file with the extension `.csv`.
<br/>You can create and modify all objects available in centctl. You can find some examples in the examples folder.
Each example can be executed directly with command : 
```sh
centctl import -f pathOfFileCSV --server nameSERVER
``` 

## Enabling shell autocompletion
### Install bash-completion
You can install it with `apt-get install bash-completion`

The above commands create `/usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion`, which is the main script of bash-completion. Depending on your package manager, you have to manually source this file in your `~/.bashrc file`.

To find out, reload your shell with command `source ~/.bashrc` and run `type _init_completion`. If the command succeeds, youâ€™re already set, otherwise add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```sh
source /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
```

Reload your shell and verify that bash-completion is correctly installed by typing `type _init_completion`

### Enable centctl autocompletion
Add the completion script to the `/etc/bash_completion.d` directory:

```sh
centctl completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell] >/etc/bash_completion.d/centctl
``` 

After reloading your shell, centctl autocompletion should be working.
